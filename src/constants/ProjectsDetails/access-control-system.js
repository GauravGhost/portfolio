This system integrates IP and serial devices to enable real-time monitoring and control, enhancing facility security and operational efficiency. The backend infrastructure, powered by Node.js (Express.js) and SQL databases, was optimized to ensure high performance and scalability. A robust role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, incorporating encrypted communication protocols to meet GDPR compliance standards and mitigate unauthorized access risks. Additionally, the system supports integration with third-party security solutions for enhanced versatility and adaptability. Regular updates and maintenance cycles ensure the system remains secure and up-to-date with the latest technology standards.",
